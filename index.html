<h2>E1: Short Movie Review</h2>
<h2>Spiderman: Far from Home</h2>
<img src="images/Spider-Man-FarFromHome-rating.jpg" width="239" height="326" />
<p>
	The title of the movie that we chose to review is the Spider-Man : Far From Home movie. The reason we chose the movie is that the movie had became a large attraction for young adolescents.
</p>
	
<h2>Publication, Director and Casts</h2>
<p>
	Spider-Man : Far From Home is a 2019 American Superhero film based on the Marvel Comics characters, Spider-Man. Co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. Spider-Man : Far From Home was directed by Jon Watts. Jon Watts is also an American film director, producer, and screen writer. His credits include directing the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero films such as the chosen movie, Spider-Man : Far From Home and the upcoming Spider-Man : No Way Home movie. Watts was also signed to direct the MCU’s Fantastic Four. 
</p>
<p>
	The cast that took part in the movie is Tom Holland, Zendaya, Jacob Batalon, Marisa Tomei, Jake Gylenhall as well as others. 
</p>
	
<h2>Year of Publication</h2>
<p>
	The year of publication for the movie for TCL Chinese Theatre was 26th June, 2019 and for United States was on the 2nd July, 2019.
</p>	
	
<h2>Short summary of the movie</h2>
<p>
	Peter Parker, who is also Spider-Man, is a friendly neighbourhood superhero who decides to join his best friend Ned, MJ, and the rest of the gang on a European vacation. However, Peter’s plan to take a break from the superhero world was scrapped when he begrudgingly agrees to help Nick Fury uncover the mystery of several elemental creature attacks, creating havoc across the continent. 
</p>
	
<h2>Reasons why you like the movie</h2>
<p>
	The reason why we like the movie is because we admire the way Peter Parker tried to be just like his mentor, Tony Stark. 
</p>
<p>
	Another reason is how the production team also focuses on their use of CGI and effects. For example, allowing the Iron Man suit worn by Tony Stark to look realistic. 
</p>

<h2>Three (3) moral values learned from the movie</h2>
<p>
	- Family over everything
</p>
<p>
	In previous Avengers movies, it was shown that Happy was employed by Tony Stark and also as his best friend. The audience would meet Happy through Stark but would quickly realise that even through the countless faces of death, it would always be family over everything. When Peter finds himself lost in a strange place, it would be Happy who would come to Peter’s rescue. It would also be Happy to ensure that Peter’s friends were already taken care of during the invasion of the drones. 
</p>
<p>
	- Live your life
</p>
<p>
	In the movie, it was shown that Peter wanted to have a normal teenage life. Unfortunately, he couldn’t as he was also Spider-Man. His life was different than when we try to fit into someone else’s dreams or vision because in reality, his ‘call was greater’ and will save millions of lives. 
</p>
<p>
	- Chosen for a reason
</p>
<p>
	Peter Parker was specifically chosen by multi-billionaire Tony Stark because Stark deemed that Peter was destined for greatness before it was revealed to him, despite being at a young age. 
</p>
	
<h2>Recommendation for others</h2>
<p>
	Our opinion on the Spider-Man : Far From Home movie for everyone is that the movie is available for audiences of all ages although having a PG-13 rating for sci-fi action violence, some language and brief suggestive comments. The movie contains a variety of stunts starring Tom Holland who stars as Peter Parker. This Spider-Man movie also has various effect elements that can attract people to watch the movie. Our suggestion to everyone is that they should be able to watch Spider-Man : Far From Home with excitement and would be able to know more about the content of the story. 
</p>
	
<h2>E2: The benefits of co-curriculur</h2>
<p>
	Co -curricular activities are very important among students. Therefore, school authorities 
should conduct or implement co-curriculum at least once a week to attract students to do new 
things each week without thinking about the problem of the study. Examples of co-curricular are 
scout club, Red Crescent Society club, math and science club, and entrepreneurship club. Do you 
know about the benefits you will get from co-curricular activities? In this essay there are 3 benefits 
of co-curricular activities.
</p>
<p>
	The first benefit you will get is social skills and relationship-building. Social skill will help 
student easy to get along with strangers like students who have been in the club for a long time and 
students who have just joined where they can work together to develop a good group. Besides that, 
students will feel more confident to present themselves in public.
</p>
<p>
	Second, students can gain benefits in time management skills. Students who do co-curricular 
activities are students who have good skills in time management. Students will be more efficient at 
dividing time to study and play. They will get enough rest and also can spend time with family or 
friends.
</p>
<p>
	Third, the benefit is that students can develop self -esteem. Not all students get good or 
excellent marks in terms of learning. Students who participate in co-curricular activities are able to 
develop talents and success or be recognized as a contribution to boosting self-esteem. This helps 
students improve their performance in lessons.
</p>
<p>
	In conclusion, Co-curricular activities are part of learning and teaching and create exciting 
experiences between students and teachers. All students need to engage in co -curricular activities 
to hone their latent talents to carve out success.
</p>
	
<h2> E3: Explain How Video Games Helps Improving Language</h2>
<p>
	Learning English in video games can help us improving our language and also can help you learn and master  English faster, and improve overall comprehension. Besides that, learning games and video games naturally require  the integration  of several linguistic skills.
</p>
<p>
	And by, removing the fear of making mistakes so common in the students.The students  also are free to practice English language while playing video games will also give a very fast effect in learning English for students.
</p>
<p>
	Essentially, learn English in video games part of experience  when living abroad and being force to interact  with people in another language. Mentally also it can help the students  to help them become the great equalizer because they help alleviate stress, increase social engagement and yes, even help students  have fun while learning English.
</p>
<p> 
	However, learning English through video games and learning games are great supplemental  tools to help students learn  and master  a language faster. Last but not least, learning language through video games also has limitations  and is no substitute  for structured lessons that provide a ftrm  foundation  in vocabulary  and grammar.
</p>
<h2>E4: How Does Physical Activities and Exercise Help During Pandemic Season?</h2>
<p>
	There are a lot of benefits that physical activity and exercise can help us. We are 
meant to move and our body’s systems work better when we consistently active. Allow me 
to list three benefits of physical activity and exercises.
</p>	
<p>
	There first benefit is that physical activity and exercise can be effective treatment 
strategies for symptoms of both depression and anxiety. Some research suggests that 
elevated levels of aerobic activity may be associated with greater reductions in depressive
symptoms. We should consider engaging physical activity once or twice daily that includes 
brief periods of greater intensity. For some, this might be accomplished through exercise in 
their homes.
</p>
<p>
	For children and adolescents, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and exercise 
during the day are associated with elevations in self-esteem, improved concentration, 
reductions in depressive symptoms and improvements in sleep. For older, adults and 
among managing chronical medication conditions, regular walks are recommend.
</p>
<p>
	The third benefit about physical activity and exercise tells about strength-training. 
Strength-training has shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety for individuals with and 
without an anxiety disorder. With strength-training, it may help us reduce the negative 
effects of stress and anxiety.
</p>
<p>
	Consistently and sustained motivation may be enhanced by peer support, family 
support or electronic platforms offering exercise programs. I recommend finding physical 
activity and exercise that we can enjoy and share our experience with others. It is also 
important for family members to take a supperfire role in the promotion of physical activity 
and exercise.
</p>
<p>
	In conclusion, please consider using physical activity and exercise as a strategy to 
maintain health during this stressful period. Although many things feel beyond our control 
right now, we do have the ability to be creative and build physical activity and exercise into 
each of our days.
